Some starting guide lines about how to add a new model component to ece2cmor3. Like
for instance adding a TM5 component or LPJ-GUESS component.

It starts with adding a few lines in the file (see the commented template lines with "NEWCOMPONENT"):
 ece2cmor3/ece2cmor.py
And by adding a function which will take care of all the tasks (see the commented template lines with 
"NEWCOMPONENT") in the file:
 ece2cmor3/ece2cmorlib.py
