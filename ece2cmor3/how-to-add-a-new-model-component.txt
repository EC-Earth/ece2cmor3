Some starting guide lines about how to add a new model component to ece2cmor3. Like
for instance adding a TM5, an LPJ-GUESS or a PISM component.

In the ece2cmor3/ece2cmor3 directory
 grep -iHn NEWCOMPONENT *.py
Gives an idea where some action is needed, as we labeled all points by "NEWCOMPONENT". So open
the involved files and study the comments an suggestive examples.

It starts with adding a few lines in the file (see the commented template lines with "NEWCOMPONENT"):
 ece2cmor3/ece2cmor.py
And by adding a function which will take care of all the tasks (see the commented template lines with 
"NEWCOMPONENT") in the file:
 ece2cmor3/ece2cmorlib.py

Further (ask if you are in doubt Thomas) a new 
 ece2cmor3/ece2cmor3/resources/NEWCOMPONENTpar.json
has to be created. Therefore in the ece2cmor3/ece2cmor3/scripts/ directory
 cp generate-tm5.json.sh generate-NEWCOMPONENT.json.sh
and replace tm5 by NEWCOMPONENT and replace the variable list in "arr" by the
list of cmor names which will be produced by your NEWCOMPONENT model component.
