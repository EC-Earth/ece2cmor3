For each MIP experiment and for each EC-Earth3 model configuration and for each
model component (ifs, nemo, tm5, lpjg), a metadata template file has been 
created in the ctrl/cmip6-output-control-files/ sub directories for each
experiment. For instance:
  cmip6-output-control-files/CMIP/EC-EARTH-AOGCM/cmip6-experiment-CMIP-historical/metadata-cmip6-CMIP-historical-EC-EARTH-AOGCM-ifs-template.json
is the one for the CMIP historical experiment for the EC-EARTH-AOGCM model 
configuration for the IFS component.

The metadata templates are generated by genecec's modify-metadata-template.sh
script.

Though most metadata should be correct, it is strongly recommended to check the
metadata template file. It is called a template because in the end one has to 
fill out the ensemble memebr fields one self:
    "realization_index":            "1",
depending on which member one is producing.
